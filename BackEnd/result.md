You've defined a function named `sum` that subtracts `b` from `a` instead of adding them. \n\nHere's the corrected function that performs addition:\n\n```javascript\nfunction sum (a, b) {\n  return a + b;\n}\n```\n\n**Explanation of the original code's behavior:**\n\nThe original code `function sum (a,b){ return a-b }` takes two arguments, `a` and `b`, and returns the result of `a - b` (a minus b).\n\n**How to use the corrected code:**\n\n```javascript\nfunction sum (a, b) {\n  return a + b;\n}\n\nlet result = sum(5, 3); // result will be 8 (5 + 3)\nconsole.log(result);\n```\n\n**Key takeaway:**\n\nIt's important to double-check your code, especially when dealing with basic mathematical operations like addition and subtraction, to ensure it behaves as intended.  A small typo can lead to unexpected results.
